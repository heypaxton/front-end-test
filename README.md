# ThinkShout front-end coding test

In order to evaluate your front-end development skills, we'd like you to create an HTML document that satisfies the following requirements.

* Contains a contact form with email, subject, and message fields along with a submit button. The action and submit handling of the form is not relevant for the test.
* Create mobile portrait and standard responses for the form.
* Leverage Foundation.
* Use LESS to write the CSS to style the form by linking the LESS javascript compiler. Actual style is not important, black text on a white background is sufficient. What we want to focus on testing is using CSS to create a responsive web page.

ThinkShout will provide a public repository containing the scaffolding for the test. Fork the repository to complete the test and publish it using GitHub pages. As a bonus, submit a pull request when complete.
