# ThinkShout front-end coding test

In order to evaluate your front-end development skills, we'd like you to create an HTML document that satisfies the following requirements.

* Contains a contact form with email, subject, and message fields along with a submit button. The action and submit handling of the form is not relevant for the test.
* Create mobile, portrait, and standard responses for the form.
* Replace the site name text with the logo assets provided in the assets folder. 
* Leverage the Bootstrap framework to build the necessary grid and create the form as shown in the wireframes below. 
* The page title, field labels, and submit button background should be orange (#F58025).
* Use LESS to write the CSS to style the form by linking the LESS javascript compiler. What we want to focus on testing is using CSS to create a responsive web page.

ThinkShout will provide a public repository containing the scaffolding for the test. Fork the repository to complete the test and publish it using GitHub pages.As a bonus, submit a pull request when complete.
